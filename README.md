# Team 4 – Solar eruptive events: tracking flares, CMEs and particles from the Sun to the heliosphere  
**Solar Orbiter Hackathon (17-21 Nov 2025)**  

**Team goal**  
We aim to better understand how solar flares and eruptive events accelerate particles at the Sun, and how those signatures evolve through the heliosphere, from remote sensing of the flare/CME to in-situ detection of energetic particles and solar wind/magnetic structures.  
We will leverage Solar Orbiter’s combined remote sensing (e.g., EUV, X-ray, coronagraph) and in-situ (particles, fields, waves) capabilities to track the full chain: energy release → flare ribbons/footpoints → CME launch → particle acceleration/transport → in-situ signatures.

**Team mentors**

- Teodora Mihailescu (INAF Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma)  
- Greta Cappello (University of Graz)  
- Jana Marković (University of Alcalá)

## 🧭 Scope & deliverables  
During the hackathon week we’ll focus on:  
1. Selecting one or more well-observed flare + CME + SEP events from Solar Orbiter data.  
2. Performing coordinated analyses:  
   - Remote sensing: flare timing, ribbon / footpoint evolution, CME morphology and kinematics.  
   - In-situ: energetic particle time series, magnetic field signatures, plasma/flow context.  
   - Linking remote observations to in-situ measurements (timing, propagation, connectivity).  
3. Producing notebooks / scripts that perform reproducible analyses (Python + SunPy, etc.).  
4. Documenting our workflow and results: summary report (markdown or Jupyter), figures, event timeline, key metrics.  
5. (Optional) Preparing a short presentation or poster summarising our findings at the end of the week.
