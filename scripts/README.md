## scripts/ – helper modules

This folder can hold small, reusable Python utilities that we’ll use across notebooks during the hackathon. None of them are “finished packages” ,  they’re meant to be hacked on.


* Utilities for finding and downloading Solar Orbiter (and related) data for our selected events.

Includes e.g.:

* Functions to search and download data via sunpy.net.Fido.
* Convenience wrappers for common instruments (STIX, EUI, SOLOHI, etc.).
