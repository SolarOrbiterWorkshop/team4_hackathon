# Event Checklist

For every event, we aim to complete the following tasks.
Different team members may contribute each part, but ALL steps must be completed
before the event can be considered “fully analysed”.

---

## 1️⃣ Remote Sensing – Flare

☐ STIX lightcurve extracted  
☐ STIX spectrum generated (thermal + nonthermal if possible)  
☐ STIX timing written into tracker sheet  
☐ EUI/SDO flare location identified  
☐ Screenshot saved in /results/EVENTDATE/

## 2️⃣ CME Analysis

☐ Metis CME presence confirmed  
☐ SoloHI CME track identified  
☐ Height–time plot produced  
☐ CME speed written in event sheet  
☐ Optional: GCS or PyThea 3D fit  
☐ Screenshot saved in /results/EVENTDATE/

## 3️⃣ SEP / In-Situ

☐ EPD electrons plotted  
☐ EPD protons plotted  
☐ SEP onset time measured  
☐ OPTIONAL: Velocity dispersion analysis (VDA)  
☐ OPTIONAL: Composition check (He3/He4, Fe/O)  
☐ Plots saved

## 4️⃣ MAG + SWA (Connectivity)

☐ Wind speed extracted from SWA  
☐ Parker spiral footpoint computed  
☐ Local B-field direction extracted from MAG  
☐ Pitch-angle distribution plotted (if possible)  
☐ Written into tracker sheet

## 5️⃣ Cross-linking

☐ Compare SEP release time with flare timing  
☐ Compare CME formation timing with release  
☐ Write 3–5 bullet summary in tracker sheet  
☐ Assign “Priority Level” (⭐ → 🚀)

## 6️⃣ Repository

☐ Notebook committed in /notebooks/  
☐ Plots committed in /results/EVENTDATE/  
☐ Event row up to date in Event Tracker
